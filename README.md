## Dataset

We have an anonymized dataset containing a large number of numeric variables. The "TARGET" column is the variable to predict. It equals 1 for unsatisfied customers and 0 for satisfied customers.

The task is to predict the probability that each customer in the test set is an unsatisfied customer.

   1. train.csv - the training set including the target
   2. test.csv - the test set without the target
